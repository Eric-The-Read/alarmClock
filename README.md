# Alarm Clock

This is an alarm clock made using PySimpleGUI. This is one of my first projects built for a GUI.

# Motivation

My motivation for this project was to build an alarm clock with some or most of the functionality one would expect from a regular alarm clock app. I wanted to learn how to structure a python project, `import` from submodules, etc. Additionally, I wanted to learn how to build a GUI, so I decided to start with something that most people use on a daily basis.

# Features

Ability to customize an alarm, which includes:
- Alarm tones
- Renaming an alarm
- Selecting days alarm plays
- Toggle alarm on/off

The time can also be formatted using the format codes in the datetime module. The formatting codes are described [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)

# Running
```
cd /path/to/directory/
python ./cli.py
```
# Note

I tried to structure this project in a logical and intuitive manner, although I imagine that the organizational system and the code contained within are a nightmare to more experienced programmers. I would love to hear your feedback, questions or concerns regarding this project.
